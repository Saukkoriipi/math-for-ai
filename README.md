# Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning

This repository contains **teaching materials** for an **introductory lecture on the mathematics of deep learning**.
It includes **Python code, Jupyter notebooks, and lecture slides (PowerPoint)** to illustrate key concepts.

⚠️ **Note:** The **lecture slides are in Finnish**, but all **code, comments, and notebooks are in English**.

## Contents

* 📂 **Code & Notebooks**

  * Implementations of **linear** and **cubic regression** trained with **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**.
  * Step-by-step visualization of the training process (loss curves, fitted models).
  * Examples of **forward passes, normalization, gradients, and updates** written in simple Python/Numpy.

* 📂 **Lecture Slides**

  * PowerPoint presentations introducing the **mathematical foundations**.
  * Covers: normalization, gradient descent, loss functions, chain rule, and regression as a gateway to neural networks.

## Models in Code

* **Linear Model**

$$
\hat{y} = w x + b
$$

* **Cubic Model**

$$
\hat{y} = w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + w_3 x^3 + b
$$

Both trained with **vanilla gradient descent**.

## Mathematics

### Normalization

Inputs and outputs are standardized with **z-score normalization**:

$$
x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}, \qquad y_{norm} = \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

### Loss Function

Training minimizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

### Gradients via Chain Rule

For the cubic model:

$$
\hat{y} = w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + w_3 x^3 + b, \quad e = \hat{y} - y
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_1} = 2 e x, \quad
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_2} = 2 e x^2, \quad
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_3} = 2 e x^3, \quad
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial b} = 2 e
$$
